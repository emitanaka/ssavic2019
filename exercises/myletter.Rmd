Welcome to the R Markdown Workshop. 

This workshop teaches you how to use R Markdown but teaches little in communicating effectively. The aim of this workshop is so that you can get used to R Markdown, which integrates code and text together with ease. 

> To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

For effective communication, seek to know your audience and extract that story that the data are telling.  

> The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; communication is getting through.     

Learning R Markdown is a step towards getting accurate information out but communication requires much more. This is why there is a benefit in coming to a workshop where you can interact with your peers. 

> Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing.     

I hope you can take this opportunity to get to know each other.
