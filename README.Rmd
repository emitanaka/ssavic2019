This repo contains material for SSAVic workshop on R Markdown.


**The slides should be opened in Google Chrome.**


My slides are written using `xaringan` but I do not recommend studying my source code if you are trying to learn `xaringan`. I am experimenting with certain components and it differs signficantly from standard usage of `xaringan`. (Feel free to talk to me about it if you want to know more).
